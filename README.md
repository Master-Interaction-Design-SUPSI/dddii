# Data Driven Design Workshop II: Lausanne Waste Visualization

This repository contains the results of the Data Driven Design II workshop, which took place at SUPSI DACD Campus in Mendrisio from February 17th to February 21st, 2025. The workshop focused on visualizing waste production data from Lausanne to inform urban design decisions.

## Project Overview

This website showcases four different approaches to understanding waste management in Lausanne:

1. **Tracing Glass**: Maps glass collection routes, connecting waste production, vehicle movements, and efficiency.
2. **Waste Generations**: Examines how age influences Lausanne's recycling efficiency.
3. **Waste Wise**: Explores how education shapes recycling habits in Lausanne.
4. **Beyond Borders**: Analyzes how nationality impacts recycling behavior across districts.

## Part of the Blue City Project

This workshop was conducted as part of the [Blue City Project](https://www.bluecity.store/), led by Professor [Jeffrey Huang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/huangjef/) at EPFL's [Media and Design Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ldm/). The project involves EPFL, ETH Zurich, HES-SO, SUPSI, and industry partners to examine urban flows in Lausanne. By collecting and mapping data on waste, energy, water, and biodiversity, the team seeks to develop planning tools that can help decision-makers address key challenges in growing cities.
